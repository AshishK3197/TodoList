# TodoList

## Created a simple Todo Application with Google's Firebase Integration for saving your todo's on cloud.

Developed a TodoList application which would be helpful in remembering and adding important day to day tasks.

This application was developed using Google’s Firebase API to authenticate the user Login and store his/her to-do’s into the application’s Firebase Fire store Database Directory.

The user would also be able to prioritize his/her tasks based upon his preference.
